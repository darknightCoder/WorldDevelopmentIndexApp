This app is made for the purpose of retrieval of various importance development index parameters of various countries like gdp gni etc
from the csv file file available at http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/WDI_csv.zip .Please extract the following file "WDI_Data.csv"
after unziping the content and place it in the root folder of this repo after cloning this repo and you can run the app.
I have now added the code for sorting countries based on gdp but soon will be doing to for other indices published by wb.Also i will be making it a web app
with cool ui feature to let user generate such results.
NOTE: the file from world bank site is quite large around 200mb so it will take some time for retrieval of the data you can look into the console for the progress.
